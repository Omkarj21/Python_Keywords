# Keywords in Python programming language =
# False & True= True(1) and False(0) are truth values in Python
# lambda : lambda is used to create an anonymous function (function with no name). It is an inline function that does not contain a return statement. It consists of an expression that is evaluated and returned
# class : class is used to define a new user-defined class in Python.
    # Class is a collection of related attributes and methods that try to represent a real world situation.
# def : def is used to define a user-defined function.
# return : return statement is used inside a function to exit it and return a value.
# is : is is used in Python for testing object identity. While the == operator is used to test if two variables are equal or not, is is used to test if the two variables refer to the same object.
# in : in is used to test if a sequence (list, tuple, string etc.) contains a value
# None = special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value, one does not imply False, 0 or any empty list, dictionary, string etc.
# break, continue:  break and continue are used inside for and while loops to alter their normal behavior.
# for : for is used for looping. Generally we use for when we know the number of times we want to loop.
# try, except, raise : are used with exceptions in Python.
    # Exceptions are basically errors that suggests something went wrong while executing our program.
    # IOError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, ImportError, NameError, TypeError etc. are few examples of exception in Python.
    # try...except blocks are used to catch exceptions in Python.
# finally : finally is used with try…except block to close up resources or file streams.
# import, as, from: as is used to create an alias while importing a module.
    # import keyword is used to import modules into the current namespace.
    # from…import is used to import specific attributes or functions into the current namespace
# global:
    # If we need to modify the value of a global variable inside a function, then we must declare it with global.
    # Otherwise a local variable with that name is created.
# nonlocal : nonlocal is used to declare that a variable inside a nested function (function inside a function) is not local to it, meaning it lies in the outer inclosing function. If we need to modify the value of a non-local variable inside a nested function, then we must declare it with nonlocal
# while : while is used for looping in Python.
# and, not, or = and, or, not are the logical operators in Python
# del :  used to delete the value
# with : with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by the context manager.
    # Context manager is a class that implements __enter__ and __exit__ methods. Use of with statement ensures that the __exit__ method is called at the end of the nested block. This concept is similar to the use of try…finally block.
# if, elif, else: if, else, elif are used for conditional branching or decision making.
# yield : yield is used inside a function like a return statement. But yield returns a generator.
# assert : assert is used for debugging purposes.
    # assert condition, message
    # If the condition is true, nothing happens. But if the condition is false, AssertionError is raised
# pass : pass is a null statement in Python. Nothing happens when it is executed. It is used as a placeholder.
